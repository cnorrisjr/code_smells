# Code Smell Refactoring Exercises

Original source material (in the `java` branch) is (C) Jason Gorman from
[Codemanship][c]. For training on TDD and refactoring code smells, check out
[Jason's training workshops][tw].

This is a modified version of [Code Smell Refactoring][cs] with some
more obvious code smells and smaller examples removed.
